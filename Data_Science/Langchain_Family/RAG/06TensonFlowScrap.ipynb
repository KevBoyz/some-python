Linear Models\\n\\n# 1.1. Linear Models#\\n\\nThe following are a set of methods intended for regression in which the target\\nvalue is expected to be a linear combination of the features. In mathematical\\nnotation, if \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{y}\\\\\\\\) is the predicted value.\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + ... + w_p x_p\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nAcross the module, we designate the vector \\\\\\\\(w = (w_1, ..., w_p)\\\\\\\\) as\\n`coef_` and \\\\\\\\(w_0\\\\\\\\) as `intercept_`.\\n\\nTo perform classification with generalized linear models, see Logistic\\nregression.\\n\\n## 1.1.1. Ordinary Least Squares#\\n\\n`LinearRegression` fits a linear model with coefficients \\\\\\\\(w = (w_1, ...,\\nw_p)\\\\\\\\) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets\\nin the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.\\nMathematically it solves a problem of the form:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} || X w - y||_2^2\\\\\\\\]\\n\\n`LinearRegression` takes in its `fit` method arguments `X`, `y`,\\n`sample_weight` and stores the coefficients \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) of the linear model in its\\n`coef_` and `intercept_` attributes:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn import linear_model\\n    >>> reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]], [0, 1, 2])\\n    LinearRegression()\\n    >>> reg.coef_\\n    array([0.5, 0.5])\\n    >>> reg.intercept_\\n    0.0\\n    \\n\\nThe coefficient estimates for Ordinary Least Squares rely on the independence\\nof the features. When features are correlated and some columns of the design\\nmatrix \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) have an approximately linear dependence, the design matrix\\nbecomes close to singular and as a result, the least-squares estimate becomes\\nhighly sensitive to random errors in the observed target, producing a large\\nvariance. This situation of _multicollinearity_ can arise, for example, when\\ndata are collected without an experimental design.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Ordinary Least Squares and Ridge Regression\\n\\n### 1.1.1.1. Non-Negative Least Squares#\\n\\nIt is possible to constrain all the coefficients to be non-negative, which may\\nbe useful when they represent some physical or naturally non-negative\\nquantities (e.g., frequency counts or prices of goods). `LinearRegression`\\naccepts a boolean `positive` parameter: when set to `True` Non-Negative Least\\nSquares are then applied.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Non-negative least squares\\n\\n### 1.1.1.2. Ordinary Least Squares Complexity#\\n\\nThe least squares solution is computed using the singular value decomposition\\nof \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\). If \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is a matrix of shape `(n_samples, n_features)` this\\nmethod has a cost of \\\\\\\\(O(n_{\\\\text{samples}} n_{\\\\text{features}}^2)\\\\\\\\),\\nassuming that \\\\\\\\(n_{\\\\text{samples}} \\\\geq n_{\\\\text{features}}\\\\\\\\).\\n\\n## 1.1.2. Ridge regression and classification#\\n\\n### 1.1.2.1. Regression#\\n\\n`Ridge` regression addresses some of the problems of Ordinary Least Squares by\\nimposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients. The ridge coefficients\\nminimize a penalized residual sum of squares:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} || X w - y||_2^2 + \\\\alpha ||w||_2^2\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThe complexity parameter \\\\\\\\(\\\\alpha \\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\) controls the amount of shrinkage:\\nthe larger the value of \\\\\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\), the greater the amount of shrinkage and\\nthus the coefficients become more robust to collinearity.\\n\\nAs with other linear models, `Ridge` will take in its `fit` method arrays `X`,\\n`y` and will store the coefficients \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) of the linear model in its `coef_`\\nmember:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn import linear_model\\n    >>> reg = linear_model.Ridge(alpha=.5)\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1]], [0, .1, 1])\\n    Ridge(alpha=0.5)\\n    >>> reg.coef_\\n    array([0.34545455, 0.34545455])\\n    >>> reg.intercept_\\n    np.float64(0.13636)\\n    \\n\\nNote that the class `Ridge` allows for the user to specify that the solver be\\nautomatically chosen by setting `solver=\"auto\"`. When this option is\\nspecified, `Ridge` will choose between the `\"lbfgs\"`, `\"cholesky\"`, and\\n`\"sparse_cg\"` solvers. `Ridge` will begin checking the conditions shown in the\\nfollowing table from top to bottom. If the condition is true, the\\ncorresponding solver is chosen.\\n\\n**Solver** | **Condition**  \\n---|---  \\n‘lbfgs’ | The `positive=True` option is specified.  \\n‘cholesky’ | The input array X is not sparse.  \\n‘sparse_cg’ | None of the above conditions are fulfilled.  \\n  \\nExamples\\n\\n  * Ordinary Least Squares and Ridge Regression\\n\\n  * Plot Ridge coefficients as a function of the regularization\\n\\n  * Common pitfalls in the interpretation of coefficients of linear models\\n\\n### 1.1.2.2. Classification#\\n\\nThe `Ridge` regressor has a classifier variant: `RidgeClassifier`. This\\nclassifier first converts binary targets to `{-1, 1}` and then treats the\\nproblem as a regression task, optimizing the same objective as above. The\\npredicted class corresponds to the sign of the regressor’s prediction. For\\nmulticlass classification, the problem is treated as multi-output regression,\\nand the predicted class corresponds to the output with the highest value.\\n\\nIt might seem questionable to use a (penalized) Least Squares loss to fit a\\nclassification model instead of the more traditional logistic or hinge losses.\\nHowever, in practice, all those models can lead to similar cross-validation\\nscores in terms of accuracy or precision/recall, while the penalized least\\nsquares loss used by the `RidgeClassifier` allows for a very different choice\\nof the numerical solvers with distinct computational performance profiles.\\n\\nThe `RidgeClassifier` can be significantly faster than e.g.\\n`LogisticRegression` with a high number of classes because it can compute the\\nprojection matrix \\\\\\\\((X^T X)^{-1} X^T\\\\\\\\) only once.\\n\\nThis classifier is sometimes referred to as a Least Squares Support Vector\\nMachine with a linear kernel.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Classification of text documents using sparse features\\n\\n### 1.1.2.3. Ridge Complexity#\\n\\nThis method has the same order of complexity as Ordinary Least Squares.\\n\\n### 1.1.2.4. Setting the regularization parameter: leave-one-out Cross-\\nValidation#\\n\\n`RidgeCV` and `RidgeClassifierCV` implement ridge regression/classification\\nwith built-in cross-validation of the alpha parameter. They work in the same\\nway as `GridSearchCV` except that it defaults to efficient Leave-One-Out\\ncross-validation. When using the default cross-validation, alpha cannot be 0\\ndue to the formulation used to calculate Leave-One-Out error. See [RL2007] for\\ndetails.\\n\\nUsage example:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> from sklearn import linear_model\\n    >>> reg = linear_model.RidgeCV(alphas=np.logspace(-6, 6, 13))\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1]], [0, .1, 1])\\n    RidgeCV(alphas=array([1.e-06, 1.e-05, 1.e-04, 1.e-03, 1.e-02, 1.e-01, 1.e+00, 1.e+01,\\n          1.e+02, 1.e+03, 1.e+04, 1.e+05, 1.e+06]))\\n    >>> reg.alpha_\\n    np.float64(0.01)\\n    \\n\\nSpecifying the value of the cv attribute will trigger the use of cross-\\nvalidation with `GridSearchCV`, for example `cv=10` for 10-fold cross-\\nvalidation, rather than Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation.\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\n[RL2007]\\n\\n“Notes on Regularized Least Squares”, Rifkin & Lippert (technical report,\\ncourse slides).\\n\\n## 1.1.3. Lasso#\\n\\nThe `Lasso` is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients. It is useful\\nin some contexts due to its tendency to prefer solutions with fewer non-zero\\ncoefficients, effectively reducing the number of features upon which the given\\nsolution is dependent. For this reason, Lasso and its variants are fundamental\\nto the field of compressed sensing. Under certain conditions, it can recover\\nthe exact set of non-zero coefficients (see Compressive sensing: tomography\\nreconstruction with L1 prior (Lasso)).\\n\\nMathematically, it consists of a linear model with an added regularization\\nterm. The objective function to minimize is:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} { \\\\frac{1}{2n_{\\\\text{samples}}} ||X w - y||_2 ^ 2 + \\\\alpha\\n||w||_1}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThe lasso estimate thus solves the minimization of the least-squares penalty\\nwith \\\\\\\\(\\\\alpha ||w||_1\\\\\\\\) added, where \\\\\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\) is a constant and\\n\\\\\\\\(||w||_1\\\\\\\\) is the \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\)-norm of the coefficient vector.\\n\\nThe implementation in the class `Lasso` uses coordinate descent as the\\nalgorithm to fit the coefficients. See Least Angle Regression for another\\nimplementation:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn import linear_model\\n    >>> reg = linear_model.Lasso(alpha=0.1)\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [1, 1]], [0, 1])\\n    Lasso(alpha=0.1)\\n    >>> reg.predict([[1, 1]])\\n    array([0.8])\\n    \\n\\nThe function `lasso_path` is useful for lower-level tasks, as it computes the\\ncoefficients along the full path of possible values.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * L1-based models for Sparse Signals\\n\\n  * Compressive sensing: tomography reconstruction with L1 prior (Lasso)\\n\\n  * Common pitfalls in the interpretation of coefficients of linear models\\n\\nNote\\n\\n**Feature selection with Lasso**\\n\\nAs the Lasso regression yields sparse models, it can thus be used to perform\\nfeature selection, as detailed in L1-based feature selection.\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\nThe following two references explain the iterations used in the coordinate\\ndescent solver of scikit-learn, as well as the duality gap computation used\\nfor convergence control.\\n\\n  * “Regularization Path For Generalized linear Models by Coordinate Descent”, Friedman, Hastie & Tibshirani, J Stat Softw, 2010 (Paper).\\n\\n  * “An Interior-Point Method for Large-Scale L1-Regularized Least Squares,” S.

Setting regularization parameter#\\n\\nThe `alpha` parameter controls the degree of sparsity of the estimated\\ncoefficients.\\n\\n#### 1.1.3.1.1. Using cross-validation#\\n\\nscikit-learn exposes objects that set the Lasso `alpha` parameter by cross-\\nvalidation: `LassoCV` and `LassoLarsCV`. `LassoLarsCV` is based on the Least\\nAngle Regression algorithm explained below.\\n\\nFor high-dimensional datasets with many collinear features, `LassoCV` is most\\noften preferable. However, `LassoLarsCV` has the advantage of exploring more\\nrelevant values of `alpha` parameter, and if the number of samples is very\\nsmall compared to the number of features, it is often faster than `LassoCV`.\\n\\n****\\n\\n#### 1.1.3.1.2. Information-criteria based model selection#\\n\\nAlternatively, the estimator `LassoLarsIC` proposes to use the Akaike\\ninformation criterion (AIC) and the Bayes Information criterion (BIC). It is a\\ncomputationally cheaper alternative to find the optimal value of alpha as the\\nregularization path is computed only once instead of k+1 times when using\\nk-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIndeed, these criteria are computed on the in-sample training set. In short,\\nthey penalize the over-optimistic scores of the different Lasso models by\\ntheir flexibility (cf. to “Mathematical details” section below).\\n\\nHowever, such criteria need a proper estimation of the degrees of freedom of\\nthe solution, are derived for large samples (asymptotic results) and assume\\nthe correct model is candidates under investigation.

AIC and BIC criteria#\\n\\nThe definition of AIC (and thus BIC) might differ in the literature. In this\\nsection, we give more information regarding the criterion computed in scikit-\\nlearn.\\n\\nMathematical details#\\n\\nThe AIC criterion is defined as:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[AIC = -2 \\\\log(\\\\hat{L}) + 2 d\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{L}\\\\\\\\) is the maximum likelihood of the model and \\\\\\\\(d\\\\\\\\) is the\\nnumber of parameters (as well referred to as degrees of freedom in the\\nprevious section).\\n\\nThe definition of BIC replaces the constant \\\\\\\\(2\\\\\\\\) by \\\\\\\\(\\\\log(N)\\\\\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[BIC = -2 \\\\log(\\\\hat{L}) + \\\\log(N) d\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) is the number of samples.\\n\\nFor a linear Gaussian model, the maximum log-likelihood is defined as:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\log(\\\\hat{L}) = - \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\log(2 \\\\pi) - \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\ln(\\\\sigma^2) -\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\\\hat{y}_i)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma^2\\\\\\\\) is an estimate of the noise variance, \\\\\\\\(y_i\\\\\\\\) and\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{y}_i\\\\\\\\) are respectively the true and predicted targets, and \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\)\\nis the number of samples.\\n\\nPlugging the maximum log-likelihood in the AIC formula yields:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[AIC = n \\\\log(2 \\\\pi \\\\sigma^2) + \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i -\\n\\\\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\\\sigma^2} + 2 d\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThe first term of the above expression is sometimes discarded since it is a\\nconstant when \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma^2\\\\\\\\) is provided. In addition, it is sometimes stated\\nthat the AIC is equivalent to the \\\\\\\\(C_p\\\\\\\\) statistic [12]. In a strict sense,\\nhowever, it is equivalent only up to some constant and a multiplicative\\nfactor.\\n\\nAt last, we mentioned above that \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma^2\\\\\\\\) is an estimate of the noise\\nvariance. In `LassoLarsIC` when the parameter `noise_variance` is not provided\\n(default), the noise variance is estimated via the unbiased estimator [13]\\ndefined as:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\\\hat{y}_i)^2}{n - p}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) is the number of features and \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{y}_i\\\\\\\\) is the predicted\\ntarget using an ordinary least squares regression.

Least Angle Regression#\\n\\nLeast-angle regression (LARS) is a regression algorithm for high-dimensional\\ndata, developed by Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone and Robert\\nTibshirani. LARS is similar to forward stepwise regression. At each step, it\\nfinds the feature most correlated with the target. When there are multiple\\nfeatures having equal correlation, instead of continuing along the same\\nfeature, it proceeds in a direction equiangular between the features.\\n\\nThe advantages of LARS are:\\n\\n  * It is numerically efficient in contexts where the number of features is significantly greater than the number of samples.\\n\\n  * It is computationally just as fast as forward selection and has the same order of complexity as ordinary least squares.\\n\\n  * It produces a full piecewise linear solution path, which is useful in cross-validation or similar attempts to tune the model.\\n\\n  * If two features are almost equally correlated with the target, then their coefficients should increase at approximately the same rate. The algorithm thus behaves as intuition would expect, and also is more stable.\\n\\n  * It is easily modified to produce solutions for other estimators, like the Lasso.\\n\\nThe disadvantages of the LARS method include:\\n\\n  * Because LARS is based upon an iterative refitting of the residuals, it would appear to be especially sensitive to the effects of noise. This problem is discussed in detail by Weisberg in the discussion section of the Efron et al. (2004) Annals of Statistics article.\\n\\nThe LARS model can be used via the estimator `Lars`, or its low-level\\nimplementation `lars_path` or `lars_path_gram`.\\n\\n## 1.1.8. LARS Lasso#\\n\\n`LassoLars` is a lasso model implemented using the LARS algorithm, and unlike\\nthe implementation based on coordinate descent, this yields the exact\\nsolution, which is piecewise linear as a function of the norm of its\\ncoefficients.\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn import linear_model\\n    >>> reg = linear_model.LassoLars(alpha=.1)\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [1, 1]], [0, 1])\\n    LassoLars(alpha=0.1)\\n    >>> reg.coef_\\n    array([0.6, 0.        ])\\n    \\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Lasso, Lasso-LARS, and Elastic Net paths\\n\\nThe LARS algorithm provides the full path of the coefficients along the\\nregularization parameter almost for free, thus a common operation is to\\nretrieve the path with one of the functions `lars_path` or `lars_path_gram`.\\n\\nMathematical formulation#\\n\\nThe algorithm is similar to forward stepwise regression, but instead of\\nincluding features at each step, the estimated coefficients are increased in a\\ndirection equiangular to each one’s correlations with the residual.\\n\\nInstead of giving a vector result, the LARS solution consists of a curve\\ndenoting the solution for each value of the \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) norm of the parameter\\nvector. The full coefficients path is stored in the array `coef_path_` of\\nshape `(n_features, max_features + 1)`.

Bayesian Regression#\\n\\nBayesian regression techniques can be used to include regularization\\nparameters in the estimation procedure: the regularization parameter is not\\nset in a hard sense but tuned to the data at hand.\\n\\nThis can be done by introducing uninformative priors over the hyper parameters\\nof the model. The \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_{2}\\\\\\\\) regularization used in Ridge regression and\\nclassification is equivalent to finding a maximum a posteriori estimation\\nunder a Gaussian prior over the coefficients \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) with precision\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\lambda^{-1}\\\\\\\\).

Automatic Relevance Determination - ARD#\\n\\nThe Automatic Relevance Determination (as being implemented in\\n`ARDRegression`) is a kind of linear model which is very similar to the\\nBayesian Ridge Regression, but that leads to sparser coefficients \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) [1]\\n[2].\\n\\n`ARDRegression` poses a different prior over \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\): it drops the spherical\\nGaussian distribution for a centered elliptic Gaussian distribution.

Logistic regression#\\n\\nThe logistic regression is implemented in `LogisticRegression`. Despite its\\nname, it is implemented as a linear model for classification rather than\\nregression in terms of the scikit-learn/ML nomenclature. The logistic\\nregression is also known in the literature as logit regression, maximum-\\nentropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier. In this model,\\nthe probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are\\nmodeled using a logistic function.\\n\\nThis implementation can fit binary, One-vs-Rest, or multinomial logistic\\nregression with optional \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\), \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) or Elastic-Net\\nregularization.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n**Regularization**\\n\\nRegularization is applied by default, which is common in machine learning but\\nnot in statistics. Another advantage of regularization is that it improves\\nnumerical stability. No regularization amounts to setting C to a very high\\nvalue.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n**Logistic Regression as a special case of the Generalized Linear Models\\n(GLM)**\\n\\nLogistic regression is a special case of Generalized Linear Models with a\\nBinomial / Bernoulli conditional distribution and a Logit link. The numerical\\noutput of the logistic regression, which is the predicted probability, can be\\nused as a classifier by applying a threshold (by default 0.5) to it. This is\\nhow it is implemented in scikit-learn, so it expects a categorical target,\\nmaking the Logistic Regression a classifier.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * L1 Penalty and Sparsity in Logistic Regression\\n\\n  * Regularization path of L1- Logistic Regression\\n\\n  * Decision Boundaries of Multinomial and One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression\\n\\n  * Multiclass sparse logistic regression on 20newgroups\\n\\n  * MNIST classification using multinomial logistic + L1\\n\\n  * Plot classification probability\\n\\n### 1.1.11.1. Binary Case#\\n\\nFor notational ease, we assume that the target \\\\\\\\(y_i\\\\\\\\) takes values in the\\nset \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\) for data point \\\\\\\\(i\\\\\\\\). Once fitted, the `predict_proba`\\nmethod of `LogisticRegression` predicts the probability of the positive class\\n\\\\\\\\(P(y_i=1|X_i)\\\\\\\\) as\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{p}(X_i) = \\\\operatorname{expit}(X_i w + w_0) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\exp(-X_i w\\n- w_0)}.\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nAs an optimization problem, binary class logistic regression with\\nregularization term \\\\\\\\(r(w)\\\\\\\\) minimizes the following cost function:\\n\\n(1)#\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} \\\\frac{1}{S}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i \\\\left(-y_i \\\\log(\\\\hat{p}(X_i)) - (1\\n- y_i) \\\\log(1 - \\\\hat{p}(X_i))\\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac{r(w)}{S C}\\\\,,\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\({s_i}\\\\\\\\) corresponds to the weights assigned by the user to a\\nspecific training sample (the vector \\\\\\\\(s\\\\\\\\) is formed by element-wise\\nmultiplication of the class weights and sample weights), and the sum \\\\\\\\(S =\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i\\\\\\\\).\\n\\nWe currently provide four choices for the regularization term \\\\\\\\(r(w)\\\\\\\\) via\\nthe `penalty` argument:\\n\\npenalty | \\\\\\\\(r(w)\\\\\\\\)  \\n---|---  \\n`None` | \\\\\\\\(0\\\\\\\\)  \\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(\\\\|w\\\\|_1\\\\\\\\)  \\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\|w\\\\|_2^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}w^T w\\\\\\\\)  \\n`ElasticNet` | \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1 - \\\\rho}{2}w^T w + \\\\rho \\\\|w\\\\|_1\\\\\\\\)  \\n  \\nFor ElasticNet, \\\\\\\\(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\) (which corresponds to the `l1_ratio` parameter)\\ncontrols the strength of \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) regularization vs. \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\)\\nregularization. Elastic-Net is equivalent to \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) when \\\\\\\\(\\\\rho = 1\\\\\\\\)\\nand equivalent to \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) when \\\\\\\\(\\\\rho=0\\\\\\\\).\\n\\nNote that the scale of the class weights and the sample weights will influence\\nthe optimization problem. For instance, multiplying the sample weights by a\\nconstant \\\\\\\\(b>0\\\\\\\\) is equivalent to multiplying the (inverse) regularization\\nstrength `C` by \\\\\\\\(b\\\\\\\\).\\n\\n### 1.1.11.2. Multinomial Case#\\n\\nThe binary case can be extended to \\\\\\\\(K\\\\\\\\) classes leading to the multinomial\\nlogistic regression, see also log-linear model.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIt is possible to parameterize a \\\\\\\\(K\\\\\\\\)-class classification model using only\\n\\\\\\\\(K-1\\\\\\\\) weight vectors, leaving one class probability fully determined by\\nthe other class probabilities by leveraging the fact that all class\\nprobabilities must sum to one. We deliberately choose to overparameterize the\\nmodel using \\\\\\\\(K\\\\\\\\) weight vectors for ease of implementation and to preserve\\nthe symmetrical inductive bias regarding ordering of classes, see [16]. This\\neffect becomes especially important when using regularization. The choice of\\noverparameterization can be detrimental for unpenalized models since then the\\nsolution may not be unique, as shown in [16].\\n\\nMathematical details#\\n\\nLet \\\\\\\\(y_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, K\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\) be the label (ordinal) encoded target\\nvariable for observation \\\\\\\\(i\\\\\\\\). Instead of a single coefficient vector, we\\nnow have a matrix of coefficients \\\\\\\\(W\\\\\\\\) where each row vector \\\\\\\\(W_k\\\\\\\\)\\ncorresponds to class \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\). We aim at predicting the class probabilities\\n\\\\\\\\(P(y_i=k|X_i)\\\\\\\\) via `predict_proba` as:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{p}_k(X_i) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(X_i W_k + W_{0, k})}{\\\\sum_{l=0}^{K-1} \\\\exp(X_i\\nW_l + W_{0, l})}.\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThe objective for the optimization becomes\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_W -\\\\frac{1}{S}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} s_{ik} [y_i = k]\\n\\\\log(\\\\hat{p}_k(X_i)) \\\\+ \\\\frac{r(W)}{S C}\\\\,,\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\([P]\\\\\\\\) represents the Iverson bracket which evaluates to \\\\\\\\(0\\\\\\\\) if\\n\\\\\\\\(P\\\\\\\\) is false, otherwise it evaluates to \\\\\\\\(1\\\\\\\\).\\n\\nAgain, \\\\\\\\(s_{ik}\\\\\\\\) are the weights assigned by the user (multiplication of\\nsample weights and class weights) with their sum \\\\\\\\(S = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} s_{ik}\\\\\\\\).\\n\\nWe currently provide four choices for the regularization term \\\\\\\\(r(W)\\\\\\\\) via\\nthe `penalty` argument, where \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) is the number of features:\\n\\npenalty | \\\\\\\\(r(W)\\\\\\\\)  \\n---|---  \\n`None` | \\\\\\\\(0\\\\\\\\)  \\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(\\\\|W\\\\|_{1,1} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m\\\\sum_{j=1}^{K}|W_{i,j}|\\\\\\\\)  \\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\|W\\\\|_F^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^m\\\\sum_{j=1}^{K} W_{i,j}^2\\\\\\\\)  \\n`ElasticNet` | \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1 - \\\\rho}{2}\\\\|W\\\\|_F^2 + \\\\rho \\\\|W\\\\|_{1,1}\\\\\\\\)  \\n  \\n### 1.1.11.3.

For `n_samples >>\\nn_features`, “newton-cholesky” is a good choice and can reach high precision\\n(tiny `tol` values). For large datasets the “saga” solver is usually faster\\n(than “lbfgs”), in particular for low precision (high `tol`). For large\\ndataset, you may also consider using `SGDClassifier` with `loss=\"log_loss\"`,\\nwhich might be even faster but requires more tuning.\\n\\n#### 1.1.11.3.1. Differences between solvers#\\n\\nThere might be a difference in the scores obtained between\\n`LogisticRegression` with `solver=liblinear` or `LinearSVC` and the external\\nliblinear library directly, when `fit_intercept=False` and the fit `coef_`\\n(or) the data to be predicted are zeroes. This is because for the sample(s)\\nwith `decision_function` zero, `LogisticRegression` and `LinearSVC` predict\\nthe negative class, while liblinear predicts the positive class. Note that a\\nmodel with `fit_intercept=False` and having many samples with\\n`decision_function` zero, is likely to be an underfit, bad model and you are\\nadvised to set `fit_intercept=True` and increase the `intercept_scaling`.\\n\\nSolvers’ details#\\n\\n  * The solver “liblinear” uses a coordinate descent (CD) algorithm, and relies on the excellent C++ LIBLINEAR library, which is shipped with scikit-learn. However, the CD algorithm implemented in liblinear cannot learn a true multinomial (multiclass) model; instead, the optimization problem is decomposed in a “one-vs-rest” fashion so separate binary classifiers are trained for all classes. This happens under the hood, so `LogisticRegression` instances using this solver behave as multiclass classifiers. For \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\\\\\) regularization `sklearn.svm.l1_min_c` allows to calculate the lower bound for C in order to get a non “null” (all feature weights to zero) model.\\n\\n  * The “lbfgs”, “newton-cg” and “sag” solvers only support \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) regularization or no regularization, and are found to converge faster for some high-dimensional data. Setting `multi_class` to “multinomial” with these solvers learns a true multinomial logistic regression model [5], which means that its probability estimates should be better calibrated than the default “one-vs-rest” setting.\\n\\n  * The “sag” solver uses Stochastic Average Gradient descent [6]. It is faster than other solvers for large datasets, when both the number of samples and the number of features are large.\\n\\n  * The “saga” solver [7] is a variant of “sag” that also supports the non-smooth `penalty=\"l1\"`. This is therefore the solver of choice for sparse multinomial logistic regression. It is also the only solver that supports `penalty=\"elasticnet\"`.\\n\\n  * The “lbfgs” is an optimization algorithm that approximates the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm [8], which belongs to quasi-Newton methods. As such, it can deal with a wide range of different training data and is therefore the default solver. Its performance, however, suffers on poorly scaled datasets and on datasets with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare categories.\\n\\n  * The “newton-cholesky” solver is an exact Newton solver that calculates the Hessian matrix and solves the resulting linear system. It is a very good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features` and can reach high precision (tiny values of `tol`), but has a few shortcomings: Only \\\\\\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\\\\\) regularization is supported. Furthermore, because the Hessian matrix is explicitly computed, the memory usage has a quadratic dependency on `n_features` as well as on `n_classes`.\\n\\nFor a comparison of some of these solvers, see [9].\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nChristopher M.

Generalized Linear Models#\\n\\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLM) extend linear models in two ways [10]. First,\\nthe predicted values \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{y}\\\\\\\\) are linked to a linear combination of the\\ninput variables \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) via an inverse link function \\\\\\\\(h\\\\\\\\) as\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{y}(w, X) = h(Xw).\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nSecondly, the squared loss function is replaced by the unit deviance \\\\\\\\(d\\\\\\\\)\\nof a distribution in the exponential family (or more precisely, a reproductive\\nexponential dispersion model (EDM) [11]).\\n\\nThe minimization problem becomes:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} \\\\frac{1}{2 n_{\\\\text{samples}}} \\\\sum_i d(y_i, \\\\hat{y}_i) +\\n\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2} ||w||_2^2,\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\) is the L2 regularization penalty. When sample weights are\\nprovided, the average becomes a weighted average.\\n\\nThe following table lists some specific EDMs and their unit deviance :\\n\\nDistribution | Target Domain | Unit Deviance \\\\\\\\(d(y, \\\\hat{y})\\\\\\\\)  \\n---|---|---  \\nNormal | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in (-\\\\infty, \\\\infty)\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\((y-\\\\hat{y})^2\\\\\\\\)  \\nBernoulli | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(2({y}\\\\log\\\\frac{y}{\\\\hat{y}}+({1}-{y})\\\\log\\\\frac{{1}-{y}}{{1}-\\\\hat{y}})\\\\\\\\)  \\nCategorical | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1, ..., k\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(2\\\\sum_{i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1, ..., k\\\\\\\\}} I(y = i) y_\\\\text{i}\\\\log\\\\frac{I(y = i)}{\\\\hat{I(y = i)}}\\\\\\\\)  \\nPoisson | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in [0, \\\\infty)\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(2(y\\\\log\\\\frac{y}{\\\\hat{y}}-y+\\\\hat{y})\\\\\\\\)  \\nGamma | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in (0, \\\\infty)\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(2(\\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\hat{y}}{y}+\\\\frac{y}{\\\\hat{y}}-1)\\\\\\\\)  \\nInverse Gaussian | \\\\\\\\(y \\\\in (0, \\\\infty)\\\\\\\\) | \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{(y-\\\\hat{y})^2}{y\\\\hat{y}^2}\\\\\\\\)  \\n  \\nThe Probability Density Functions (PDF) of these distributions are illustrated\\nin the following figure,\\n\\nPDF of a random variable Y following Poisson, Tweedie (power=1.5) and Gamma\\ndistributions with different mean values (\\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\)). Observe the point mass\\nat \\\\\\\\(Y=0\\\\\\\\) for the Poisson distribution and the Tweedie (power=1.5)\\ndistribution, but not for the Gamma distribution which has a strictly positive\\ntarget domain.#\\n\\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution modelling a\\nBernoulli trial - an event that has only two mutually exclusive outcomes. The\\nCategorical distribution is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for\\na categorical random variable. While a random variable in a Bernoulli\\ndistribution has two possible outcomes, a Categorical random variable can take\\non one of K possible categories, with the probability of each category\\nspecified separately.\\n\\nThe choice of the distribution depends on the problem at hand:\\n\\n  * If the target values \\\\\\\\(y\\\\\\\\) are counts (non-negative integer valued) or relative frequencies (non-negative), you might use a Poisson distribution with a log-link.\\n\\n  * If the target values are positive valued and skewed, you might try a Gamma distribution with a log-link.\\n\\n  * If the target values seem to be heavier tailed than a Gamma distribution, you might try an Inverse Gaussian distribution (or even higher variance powers of the Tweedie family).\\n\\n  * If the target values \\\\\\\\(y\\\\\\\\) are probabilities, you can use the Bernoulli distribution. The Bernoulli distribution with a logit link can be used for binary classification. The Categorical distribution with a softmax link can be used for multiclass classification.\\n\\nExamples of use cases#\\n\\n  * Agriculture / weather modeling: number of rain events per year (Poisson), amount of rainfall per event (Gamma), total rainfall per year (Tweedie / Compound Poisson Gamma).\\n\\n  * Risk modeling / insurance policy pricing: number of claim events / policyholder per year (Poisson), cost per event (Gamma), total cost per policyholder per year (Tweedie / Compound Poisson Gamma).\\n\\n  * Credit Default: probability that a loan can’t be paid back (Bernoulli).\\n\\n  * Fraud Detection: probability that a financial transaction like a cash transfer is a fraudulent transaction (Bernoulli).\\n\\n  * Predictive maintenance: number of production interruption events per year (Poisson), duration of interruption (Gamma), total interruption time per year (Tweedie / Compound Poisson Gamma).\\n\\n  * Medical Drug Testing: probability of curing a patient in a set of trials or probability that a patient will experience side effects (Bernoulli).\\n\\n  * News Classification: classification of news articles into three categories namely Business News, Politics and Entertainment news (Categorical).\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[10]\\n\\nMcCullagh, Peter; Nelder, John (1989).

Usage#\\n\\n`TweedieRegressor` implements a generalized linear model for the Tweedie\\ndistribution, that allows to model any of the above mentioned distributions\\nusing the appropriate `power` parameter. In particular:\\n\\n  * `power = 0`: Normal distribution. Specific estimators such as `Ridge`, `ElasticNet` are generally more appropriate in this case.\\n\\n  * `power = 1`: Poisson distribution. `PoissonRegressor` is exposed for convenience. However, it is strictly equivalent to `TweedieRegressor(power=1, link=\\'log\\')`.\\n\\n  * `power = 2`: Gamma distribution. `GammaRegressor` is exposed for convenience. However, it is strictly equivalent to `TweedieRegressor(power=2, link=\\'log\\')`.\\n\\n  * `power = 3`: Inverse Gaussian distribution.\\n\\nThe link function is determined by the `link` parameter.\\n\\nUsage example:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import TweedieRegressor\\n    >>> reg = TweedieRegressor(power=1, alpha=0.5, link=\\'log\\')\\n    >>> reg.fit([[0, 0], [0, 1], [2, 2]], [0, 1, 2])\\n    TweedieRegressor(alpha=0.5, link=\\'log\\', power=1)\\n    >>> reg.coef_\\n    array([0.2463, 0.4337])\\n    >>> reg.intercept_\\n    np.float64(-0.7638)\\n    \\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Poisson regression and non-normal loss\\n\\n  * Tweedie regression on insurance claims\\n\\nPractical considerations#\\n\\nThe feature matrix `X` should be standardized before fitting. This ensures\\nthat the penalty treats features equally.\\n\\nSince the linear predictor \\\\\\\\(Xw\\\\\\\\) can be negative and Poisson, Gamma and\\nInverse Gaussian distributions don’t support negative values, it is necessary\\nto apply an inverse link function that guarantees the non-negativeness. For\\nexample with `link=\\'log\\'`, the inverse link function becomes\\n\\\\\\\\(h(Xw)=\\\\exp(Xw)\\\\\\\\).\\n\\nIf you want to model a relative frequency, i.e. counts per exposure (time,\\nvolume, …) you can do so by using a Poisson distribution and passing\\n\\\\\\\\(y=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{counts}}{\\\\mathrm{exposure}}\\\\\\\\) as target values together\\nwith \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathrm{exposure}\\\\\\\\) as sample weights. For a concrete example see\\ne.g. Tweedie regression on insurance claims.\\n\\nWhen performing cross-validation for the `power` parameter of\\n`TweedieRegressor`, it is advisable to specify an explicit `scoring` function,\\nbecause the default scorer `TweedieRegressor.score` is a function of `power`\\nitself.\\n\\n## 1.1.13. Stochastic Gradient Descent - SGD#\\n\\nStochastic gradient descent is a simple yet very efficient approach to fit\\nlinear models. It is particularly useful when the number of samples (and the\\nnumber of features) is very large. The `partial_fit` method allows online/out-\\nof-core learning.\\n\\nThe classes `SGDClassifier` and `SGDRegressor` provide functionality to fit\\nlinear models for classification and regression using different (convex) loss\\nfunctions and different penalties. E.g., with `loss=\"log\"`, `SGDClassifier`\\nfits a logistic regression model, while with `loss=\"hinge\"` it fits a linear\\nsupport vector machine (SVM).\\n\\nYou can refer to the dedicated Stochastic Gradient Descent documentation\\nsection for more details.\\n\\n## 1.1.14. Perceptron#\\n\\nThe `Perceptron` is another simple classification algorithm suitable for large\\nscale learning. By default:\\n\\n  * It does not require a learning rate.\\n\\n  * It is not regularized (penalized).\\n\\n  * It updates its model only on mistakes.\\n\\nThe last characteristic implies that the Perceptron is slightly faster to\\ntrain than SGD with the hinge loss and that the resulting models are sparser.\\n\\nIn fact, the `Perceptron` is a wrapper around the `SGDClassifier` class using\\na perceptron loss and a constant learning rate. Refer to mathematical section\\nof the SGD procedure for more details.\\n\\n## 1.1.15. Passive Aggressive Algorithms#\\n\\nThe passive-aggressive algorithms are a family of algorithms for large-scale\\nlearning. They are similar to the Perceptron in that they do not require a\\nlearning rate. However, contrary to the Perceptron, they include a\\nregularization parameter `C`.\\n\\nFor classification, `PassiveAggressiveClassifier` can be used with\\n`loss=\\'hinge\\'` (PA-I) or `loss=\\'squared_hinge\\'` (PA-II). For regression,\\n`PassiveAggressiveRegressor` can be used with `loss=\\'epsilon_insensitive\\'`\\n(PA-I) or `loss=\\'squared_epsilon_insensitive\\'` (PA-II).\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\n  * “Online Passive-Aggressive Algorithms” K. Crammer, O. Dekel, J. Keshat, S. Shalev-Shwartz, Y. Singer - JMLR 7 (2006)\\n\\n## 1.1.16. Robustness regression: outliers and modeling errors#\\n\\nRobust regression aims to fit a regression model in the presence of corrupt\\ndata: either outliers, or error in the model.\\n\\n### 1.1.16.1. Different scenario and useful concepts#\\n\\nThere are different things to keep in mind when dealing with data corrupted by\\noutliers:\\n\\n  * **Outliers in X or in y**?\\n\\nOutliers in the y direction | Outliers in the X direction  \\n---|---  \\n|  \\n  \\n  * **Fraction of outliers versus amplitude of error**\\n\\nThe number of outlying points matters, but also how much they are outliers.\\n\\nSmall outliers | Large outliers  \\n---|---  \\n|  \\n  \\n\\nAn important notion of robust fitting is that of breakdown point: the fraction\\nof data that can be outlying for the fit to start missing the inlying data.\\n\\nNote that in general, robust fitting in high-dimensional setting (large\\n`n_features`) is very hard. The robust models here will probably not work in\\nthese settings.\\n\\nTrade-offs: which estimator ?\\n\\nScikit-learn provides 3 robust regression estimators: RANSAC, Theil Sen and\\nHuberRegressor.\\n\\n  * HuberRegressor should be faster than RANSAC and Theil Sen unless the number of samples is very large, i.e. `n_samples` >> `n_features`. This is because RANSAC and Theil Sen fit on smaller subsets of the data. However, both Theil Sen and RANSAC are unlikely to be as robust as HuberRegressor for the default parameters.\\n\\n  * RANSAC is faster than Theil Sen and scales much better with the number of samples.\\n\\n  * RANSAC will deal better with large outliers in the y direction (most common situation).\\n\\n  * Theil Sen will cope better with medium-size outliers in the X direction, but this property will disappear in high-dimensional settings.\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use RANSAC.\\n\\n### 1.1.16.2. RANSAC: RANdom SAmple Consensus#\\n\\nRANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) fits a model from random subsets of inliers\\nfrom the complete data set.\\n\\nRANSAC is a non-deterministic algorithm producing only a reasonable result\\nwith a certain probability, which is dependent on the number of iterations\\n(see `max_trials` parameter). It is typically used for linear and non-linear\\nregression problems and is especially popular in the field of photogrammetric\\ncomputer vision.\\n\\nThe algorithm splits the complete input sample data into a set of inliers,\\nwhich may be subject to noise, and outliers, which are e.g. caused by\\nerroneous measurements or invalid hypotheses about the data. The resulting\\nmodel is then estimated only from the determined inliers.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Robust linear model estimation using RANSAC\\n\\n  * Robust linear estimator fitting\\n\\nDetails of the algorithm#\\n\\nEach iteration performs the following steps:\\n\\n  1. Select `min_samples` random samples from the original data and check whether the set of data is valid (see `is_data_valid`).\\n\\n  2. Fit a model to the random subset (`estimator.fit`) and check whether the estimated model is valid (see `is_model_valid`).\\n\\n  3. Classify all data as inliers or outliers by calculating the residuals to the estimated model (`estimator.predict(X) - y`) - all data samples with absolute residuals smaller than or equal to the `residual_threshold` are considered as inliers.\\n\\n  4. Save fitted model as best model if number of inlier samples is maximal. In case the current estimated model has the same number of inliers, it is only considered as the best model if it has better score.\\n\\nThese steps are performed either a maximum number of times (`max_trials`) or\\nuntil one of the special stop criteria are met (see `stop_n_inliers` and\\n`stop_score`). The final model is estimated using all inlier samples\\n(consensus set) of the previously determined best model.\\n\\nThe `is_data_valid` and `is_model_valid` functions allow to identify and\\nreject degenerate combinations of random sub-samples. If the estimated model\\nis not needed for identifying degenerate cases, `is_data_valid` should be used\\nas it is called prior to fitting the model and thus leading to better\\ncomputational performance.\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\n  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC\\n\\n  * “Random Sample Consensus: A Paradigm for Model Fitting with Applications to Image Analysis and Automated Cartography” Martin A.

Theil-Sen estimator: generalized-median-based estimator#\\n\\nThe `TheilSenRegressor` estimator uses a generalization of the median in\\nmultiple dimensions. It is thus robust to multivariate outliers. Note however\\nthat the robustness of the estimator decreases quickly with the dimensionality\\nof the problem. It loses its robustness properties and becomes no better than\\nan ordinary least squares in high dimension.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Theil-Sen Regression\\n\\n  * Robust linear estimator fitting\\n\\nTheoretical considerations#\\n\\n`TheilSenRegressor` is comparable to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in terms\\nof asymptotic efficiency and as an unbiased estimator. In contrast to OLS,\\nTheil-Sen is a non-parametric method which means it makes no assumption about\\nthe underlying distribution of the data. Since Theil-Sen is a median-based\\nestimator, it is more robust against corrupted data aka outliers. In\\nunivariate setting, Theil-Sen has a breakdown point of about 29.3% in case of\\na simple linear regression which means that it can tolerate arbitrary\\ncorrupted data of up to 29.3%.\\n\\nThe implementation of `TheilSenRegressor` in scikit-learn follows a\\ngeneralization to a multivariate linear regression model [14] using the\\nspatial median which is a generalization of the median to multiple dimensions\\n[15].\\n\\nIn terms of time and space complexity, Theil-Sen scales according to\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\binom{n_{\\\\text{samples}}}{n_{\\\\text{subsamples}}}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhich makes it infeasible to be applied exhaustively to problems with a large\\nnumber of samples and features. Therefore, the magnitude of a subpopulation\\ncan be chosen to limit the time and space complexity by considering only a\\nrandom subset of all possible combinations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[14]\\n\\nXin Dang, Hanxiang Peng, Xueqin Wang and Heping Zhang: Theil-Sen Estimators in\\na Multiple Linear Regression Model.\\n\\n[15]\\n\\n  20.

Huber Regression#\\n\\nThe `HuberRegressor` is different from `Ridge` because it applies a linear\\nloss to samples that are defined as outliers by the `epsilon` parameter. A\\nsample is classified as an inlier if the absolute error of that sample is less\\nthan the threshold `epsilon`. It differs from `TheilSenRegressor` and\\n`RANSACRegressor` because it does not ignore the effect of the outliers but\\ngives a lesser weight to them.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * HuberRegressor vs Ridge on dataset with strong outliers\\n\\nMathematical details#\\n\\n`HuberRegressor` minimizes\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w, \\\\sigma} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\sigma + H_{\\\\epsilon}\\\\left(\\\\frac{X_{i}w\\n- y_{i}}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right)\\\\sigma\\\\right) + \\\\alpha {||w||_2}^2}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nwhere the loss function is given by\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\begin{split}H_{\\\\epsilon}(z) = \\\\begin{cases} z^2, & \\\\text {if } |z| <\\n\\\\epsilon, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2\\\\epsilon|z| - \\\\epsilon^2, & \\\\text{otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\\\end{split}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nIt is advised to set the parameter `epsilon` to 1.35 to achieve 95%\\nstatistical efficiency.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n  * Peter J. Huber, Elvezio M. Ronchetti: Robust Statistics, Concomitant scale estimates, p. 172.\\n\\nThe `HuberRegressor` differs from using `SGDRegressor` with loss set to\\n`huber` in the following ways.\\n\\n  * `HuberRegressor` is scaling invariant. Once `epsilon` is set, scaling `X` and `y` down or up by different values would produce the same robustness to outliers as before. as compared to `SGDRegressor` where `epsilon` has to be set again when `X` and `y` are scaled.\\n\\n  * `HuberRegressor` should be more efficient to use on data with small number of samples while `SGDRegressor` needs a number of passes on the training data to produce the same robustness.\\n\\nNote that this estimator is different from the R implementation of Robust\\nRegression because the R implementation does a weighted least squares\\nimplementation with weights given to each sample on the basis of how much the\\nresidual is greater than a certain threshold.\\n\\n## 1.1.17. Quantile Regression#\\n\\nQuantile regression estimates the median or other quantiles of \\\\\\\\(y\\\\\\\\)\\nconditional on \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\), while ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates the\\nconditional mean.\\n\\nQuantile regression may be useful if one is interested in predicting an\\ninterval instead of point prediction. Sometimes, prediction intervals are\\ncalculated based on the assumption that prediction error is distributed\\nnormally with zero mean and constant variance. Quantile regression provides\\nsensible prediction intervals even for errors with non-constant (but\\npredictable) variance or non-normal distribution.\\n\\nBased on minimizing the pinball loss, conditional quantiles can also be\\nestimated by models other than linear models. For example,\\n`GradientBoostingRegressor` can predict conditional quantiles if its parameter\\n`loss` is set to `\"quantile\"` and parameter `alpha` is set to the quantile\\nthat should be predicted. See the example in Prediction Intervals for Gradient\\nBoosting Regression.\\n\\nMost implementations of quantile regression are based on linear programming\\nproblem. The current implementation is based on `scipy.optimize.linprog`.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n  * Quantile regression\\n\\nMathematical details#\\n\\nAs a linear model, the `QuantileRegressor` gives linear predictions\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{y}(w, X) = Xw\\\\\\\\) for the \\\\\\\\(q\\\\\\\\)-th quantile, \\\\\\\\(q \\\\in (0, 1)\\\\\\\\). The\\nweights or coefficients \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) are then found by the following minimization\\nproblem:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\min_{w} {\\\\frac{1}{n_{\\\\text{samples}}} \\\\sum_i PB_q(y_i - X_i w) + \\\\alpha\\n||w||_1}.\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThis consists of the pinball loss (also known as linear loss), see also\\n`mean_pinball_loss`,\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\begin{split}PB_q(t) = q \\\\max(t, 0) + (1 - q) \\\\max(-t, 0) = \\\\begin{cases} q\\nt, & t > 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & t = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ (q-1) t, & t < 0 \\\\end{cases}\\\\end{split}\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nand the L1 penalty controlled by parameter `alpha`, similar to `Lasso`.\\n\\nAs the pinball loss is only linear in the residuals, quantile regression is\\nmuch more robust to outliers than squared error based estimation of the mean.\\nSomewhat in between is the `HuberRegressor`.\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\n  * Koenker, R., & Bassett Jr, G.

Polynomial regression: extending linear models with basis\\nfunctions#\\n\\nOne common pattern within machine learning is to use linear models trained on\\nnonlinear functions of the data. This approach maintains the generally fast\\nperformance of linear methods, while allowing them to fit a much wider range\\nof data.\\n\\nMathematical details#\\n\\nFor example, a simple linear regression can be extended by constructing\\n**polynomial features** from the coefficients. In the standard linear\\nregression case, you might have a model that looks like this for two-\\ndimensional data:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nIf we want to fit a paraboloid to the data instead of a plane, we can combine\\nthe features in second-order polynomials, so that the model looks like this:\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_1 x_2 + w_4 x_1^2 + w_5\\nx_2^2\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nThe (sometimes surprising) observation is that this is _still a linear model_\\n: to see this, imagine creating a new set of features\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[z = [x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2]\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nWith this re-labeling of the data, our problem can be written\\n\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\hat{y}(w, z) = w_0 + w_1 z_1 + w_2 z_2 + w_3 z_3 + w_4 z_4 + w_5 z_5\\\\\\\\]\\n\\nWe see that the resulting _polynomial regression_ is in the same class of\\nlinear models we considered above (i.e. the model is linear in \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\)) and\\ncan be solved by the same techniques. By considering linear fits within a\\nhigher-dimensional space built with these basis functions, the model has the\\nflexibility to fit a much broader range of data.\\n\\nHere is an example of applying this idea to one-dimensional data, using\\npolynomial features of varying degrees:\\n\\nThis figure is created using the `PolynomialFeatures` transformer, which\\ntransforms an input data matrix into a new data matrix of a given degree. It\\ncan be used as follows:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> X = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)\\n    >>> X\\n    array([[0, 1],\\n           [2, 3],\\n           [4, 5]])\\n    >>> poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)\\n    >>> poly.fit_transform(X)\\n    array([[ 1.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.],\\n           [ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  6.,  9.],\\n           [ 1.,  4.,  5., 16., 20., 25.]])\\n    \\n\\nThe features of `X` have been transformed from \\\\\\\\([x_1, x_2]\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\([1, x_1,\\nx_2, x_1^2, x_1 x_2, x_2^2]\\\\\\\\), and can now be used within any linear model.\\n\\nThis sort of preprocessing can be streamlined with the Pipeline tools. A\\nsingle object representing a simple polynomial regression can be created and\\nused as follows:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\n    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\\n    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> model = Pipeline([(\\'poly\\', PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)),\\n    ...                   (\\'linear\\', LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False))])\\n    >>> # fit to an order-3 polynomial data\\n    >>> x = np.arange(5)\\n    >>> y = 3 - 2 * x + x ** 2 - x ** 3\\n    >>> model = model.fit(x[:, np.newaxis], y)\\n    >>> model.named_steps[\\'linear\\'].coef_\\n    array([ 3., -2.,  1., -1.])\\n    \\n\\nThe linear model trained on polynomial features is able to exactly recover the\\ninput polynomial coefficients.\\n\\nIn some cases it’s not necessary to include higher powers of any single\\nfeature, but only the so-called _interaction features_ that multiply together\\nat most \\\\\\\\(d\\\\\\\\) distinct features. These can be gotten from\\n`PolynomialFeatures` with the setting `interaction_only=True`.\\n\\nFor example, when dealing with boolean features, \\\\\\\\(x_i^n = x_i\\\\\\\\) for all\\n\\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) and is therefore useless; but \\\\\\\\(x_i x_j\\\\\\\\) represents the conjunction\\nof two booleans. This way, we can solve the XOR problem with a linear\\nclassifier:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\\n    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])\\n    >>> y = X[:, 0] ^ X[:, 1]\\n    >>> y\\n    array([0, 1, 1, 0])\\n    >>> X = PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True).fit_transform(X).astype(int)\\n    >>> X\\n    array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\\n           [1, 0, 1, 0],\\n           [1, 1, 0, 0],\\n           [1, 1, 1, 1]])\\n    >>> clf = Perceptron(fit_intercept=False, max_iter=10, tol=None,\\n    ...                  shuffle=False).fit(X, y)\\n    \\n\\nAnd the classifier “predictions” are perfect:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    >>> clf.predict(X)\\n    array([0, 1, 1, 0])\\n    >>> clf.score(X, y)\\n    1.0\\n    \\n\\n__\\n\\nprevious\\n\\n1\\\\.
